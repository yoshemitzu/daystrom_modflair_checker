# daystrom_modflair_checker
This script is intended to compare the number of moderator-flaired posts to the number of user-flaired posts in /r/DaystromInstitute. You will not be able to use this post if you're not a moderator of /r/DaystromInstitute, because it relies on access to that subreddit's moderation log.
